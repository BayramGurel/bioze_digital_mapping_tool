<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment before running the project to manage dependencies effectively. If you encounter issues installing PyScipopt, please create a new environment with Python version 3.8.
  ```sh
  conda install --channel conda-forge pyscipopt
  ```

## Exceed Resource Limits

* Upgrade the Streamlit version of the app to the latest release.
* Optimize memory usage of the app, refers to these [tips](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#app-resources-and-limits "Manage your app resources and limits").
