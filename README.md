  ```sh
  conda create -n ox -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority osmnx
  ```

* Upgrade the Streamlit version of the app to the latest release.
* Optimize memory usage of the app, refers to these [tips](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#app-resources-and-limits "Manage your app resources and limits").
